# Motion-detection-and-tracking
Problem statement
Motion detection and tracking system:

1. create a tracker based on motion in python.
2. It should be able to detect motion from your webcam and then also track each object motion simultaneously, keeping track of each object.
3. You have to implement preprocessing and post processing on your input image to improve the results.
4. You then need to show input image, preprocessed image, post processed motion mask and final image with object tracking.
